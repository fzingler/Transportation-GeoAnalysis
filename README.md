## Overview
This project demonstrates various network analysis techniques using Python and NetworkX. It includes community detection, centrality measures, flow analysis, dynamic simulations, and resilience analysis. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and visualizes network properties and behaviors.

## Features
- **Community Detection**: Louvain method for identifying communities in a graph.
- **Centrality Measures**:
  - Betweenness Centrality
  - Degree Centrality
- **Flow Analysis**:
  - Maximum Flow (Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm)
  - Minimum Cost Flow
  - Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- **Dynamic Network Simulations**:
  - Traffic congestion spread using SIR models.
  - Time-varying network analysis with ARIMA modeling.
- **Resilience Analysis**:
  - Node and edge connectivity.
  - Targeted attack simulations.
- **Multimodal Network Analysis**:
  - Flow allocation between direct and multimodal routes.
- **Visualization**:
  - Graph visualizations with community coloring, centrality-based node sizing, and dynamic animations.
